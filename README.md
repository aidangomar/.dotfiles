# Note

I do most development on remote machines, and sometimes i have to switch between them, so I have a remote tmux config, and a local tmux config

Future bindings
- Use cmd - j/k to toggle focus between monitors if I ever start using them
    - Change arc tabs keybinding to something else
- Use cmd + shift - 1..9 to quick toggle monitors
